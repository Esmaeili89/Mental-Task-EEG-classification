# Classification of mental tasks Using EEG Signals with Common spatial Pattern (CSP) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 

This repository contains MATLAB code for classifying Mental tasks using EEG signals, enhanced through the application of PSO. The associated research paper was published in the Elixir International Journal under the title "Performance Analysis of PSO and GA Algorithms in Order to Classifying EEG Data". The only difference is that CSP is used instead of PCA in this code.
